I'm Fran, currently diving into the world of software development at 42 Madrid Fundación Telefónica. In my previous life, I was knee-deep in the audiovisual scene, rocking it as an event producer. Now, my heart beats for low-level 
programming, backend systems, and creating awesome graphics and video games. You'll often find me immersed in C, C++, and Bash, exploring the endless possibilities they offer. Let's build something beautiful.
