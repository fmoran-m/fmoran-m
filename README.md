I'm Fran, a software developer from Madrid and a current student at 42 School. I learned programming from the ground up, starting with C and C++, so low-level will always be a part of me.

I am currently exploring the world of web development, backend engineering, and system administration. I also enjoy designing and coding small video games whenever I have the time.
